While TensorFlow Lite inference is active, processing 50 frames in 5 seconds (10 FPS) with an average inference time of 503ms per detection is slow. This latency significantly impacts real-time monitoring capabilities.\n\nOccupancy detection shows inconsistent tracking. Four people were detected in total, but only one is currently recognized. This could indicate issues with tracking or detection accuracy.\n\nFrom a safety perspective, slow processing and potentially inaccurate occupancy tracking raise concerns. Delayed alerts based on driver fatigue or distraction could compromise safety. The system's utility in preventing accidents is limited by its current performance.\n\n**Recommendations:** Optimize inference speed by exploring model quantization or hardware acceleration. Improve tracking accuracy to ensure consistent and reliable occupancy monitoring. Investigate the discrepancy between total and current people detected to address potential detection flaws. These improvements are crucial for effective in-car safety monitoring.\n\n\n\ud83d\udcf1 Powered by Google Gemini AI", "metadata": {"frames_processed": 50, "people_detected": 4, "processing_time_seconds": 5.0, "video_source": "Sample Video", "inference_time_ms": 503.57144, "total_detections": 7}, "timestamp": "2025-07-19T17:18:22.118Z", "server_timestamp": "2025-07-19T19:18:24.463968"}
